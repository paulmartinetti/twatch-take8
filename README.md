<p>Repository name - WakeupFromSensor2</p>

<p>
Author - experienced dad and programmer, new to Arduino, C++, got a couple ttgo 2020s for my 12 yo son and me. We like the retro look. A flick of the wrist wakes up the watch from light sleep. Battery lasts all day. Wifi connection updates time, working on simple weather read-out
<br>
<br>
NOTE - there are 4 vars needed for this to work: your wifi ssid, pw, your lat/lon coordinates, and your connection to api.bigdatacloud.net and api.openweathermap.org (key needed) or whatever data you want to pull..

Repository<br>
strengths - sleep and wake functions, light-weight state management<br>
weaknesses - err checking, compartmentalizing / reusing code, data-types..need to use more char's<br>
