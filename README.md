<p>Repository name - WakeupFromSensor2</p>

<p>
Author - experienced dad and programmer, new to Arduino, C++, got a couple ttgo 2020s for my 12 yo son and me. We like the retro look. A flick of the wrist wakes up the watch from light sleep. Battery lasts all day. Wifi connection updates time, working on simple weather read-out
<br>
<br>
Instructions:
1. Open WakeupFromSensor2.ino in the Arduino IDE, say Yes to create a new folder with the same name.
<br>
2. In config.h, replace the 4 placeholder variables with your info, see comments for details
<br>
3. In wifiTime, there may be features commented out. I need time to compartmentalize the code. Thanks for your patience.

Repository<br>
strengths - sleep and wake functions, light-weight state management<br>
weaknesses - err checking, compartmentalizing / reusing code, data-types..need to use more char's<br>
