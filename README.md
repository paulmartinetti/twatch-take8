# WakeupFromSensor2

# experienced dad and programmer, new to Arduino, C++, got a couple ttgo 2020s for my 12 yo son and me. We like the retro look. A flick of the wrist wakes up the watch from light sleep. Battery lasts all day. Wifi connection updates time, working on simple weather read-out

Repository
strengths - sleep and wake functions, light-weight state management
weaknesses - err checking, compartmentalizing / reusing code, data-types..need to use more char's


# vvv--I'm using bits of code from these brilliant folks and resources--vvv
